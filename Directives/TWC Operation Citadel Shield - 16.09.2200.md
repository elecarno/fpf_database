DIRECTIVE TITLE: Operation Citadel Shield

### DIRECTIVE OUTLINE
High Command is thrilled to report the successful progression of our ongoing construction project, all under the exceptional leadership of [[FP-14 Mik]]. This achievement is monumental and signals our unwavering commitment to the cause.

**Valhalla Outpost: A Fortress of Titan Proportions**
[[TWC-S-04 Valhalla Station]], the rock-solid bastion of our might, has been transformed into a fortress that would make Rico himself proud. Thanks to [[FP-14 Mik]]'s tenacity, it currently boasts:
- Hydrogen Tanks: 122 (Enough to make even a Tanker Bug blush)
- Assemblers: 2 with 2 speed modules each (Faster than a Bug's leap)
- Refineries: 4 with 4 yield modules each (Extracting resources like a Morita rifle on full auto)
- Batteries: 6 (More power than a Marauder suit)
- Twin-Blade Wind Turbines: 3 (Spinning faster than a Dropship crash-landing)
- Large Cargo Containers: 10 (Storing supplies like a Mobile Infantry cache)
- Rover/Tank Hangar (For our very own Roughnecks)
- O2/H2 Generators: 7 (Breathing easier than an M8 Ape)
- Barracks and Recreation Area: 1 (Because even heroes need downtime)
- B&R Nanobot System (Build and Repair): (As quick as a Roughneck's reflexes)
- A fresh coat of paint is coming soon, giving Valhalla Outpost a look that would make Carmen proud!

I personally have Visited......
Rarely out the lab these days, But what a treat it was to see it come so far.
Left a little gift in respect of your hardship
May this small combat/prospector do you well

High Command eagerly anticipates future Upgrades for Valhalla eventual full return.

**Field Marshal Mik - The Roughneck of Our Dreams**
In recognition of [[FP-14 Mik]]'s valiant efforts and unyielding dedication to the `TWC` cause, we hereby dub them "Field Marshal." This promotion is as well-deserved as a Warrior Bug squashed under a boot and demonstrates our utmost respect and confidence in Mik's command.

The `TWC` is a family united by a common cause and an unshakable belief in our mission. Field Marshal Mik is a testament to the kind of leadership that propels us forward, and we eagerly await more victories under his command.
Together, we stand strong against the Symbiote threat. Join us, and let's forge a brighter tomorrow!

*P.S. Stand with Us, Build Our Future*

Should you have the passion, ingenuity, and grit to aid us in our mission, remember that we are a united front. We are always eager to welcome more hands and hearts into our ranks. If you have projects, dreams, or ideas that can propel us further in our battle against the Symbiote menace, don't hesitate to step forward. Together, we'll forge a future that will make history.
