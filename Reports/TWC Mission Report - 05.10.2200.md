COLOQUIAL TITLE: N/A

MISSION GOALS: ELIMINATING 4 SYMBIOT BEHEMOTH´S AND STOPPING THEM FROM SUPPLYING THE ONE
MISSION RESULTS: SUCCESSFUL

### MISSION BREIFING:
GATHER OUR FORCES AND TAKE THE BEHEMOTH´S OUT 1 BY 1

### DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS:
H-C STARTED THE MISSION BY ATTACKING THE 1ST BEHEMOTH, IN THEIR TYPE-07 BUT AFTER REALISING THEIR WEAPONS WERE INEFFECTIVE, THEY HAD TO RETREAT AND DEPLOY THE MORE CAPABLE WARSHIP "LEVIATHAN" AFTER NOTICING A WEAKNESS IN THE BEHEMOTHS POWER SUPPLY THEY SINGLE HANDEDLY TOOK IT OUT AND PROCEEDED TO LINKED UP WITH THE REST OF THE FORCE WHICH AT THE TIME HAD BASICALLY TAKEN OUT THE 2ND BEHEMOTH WITH MINIMAL DAMAGE TAKEN SO FAR.

THE VALKYRIE WAS THE FIRST TO JUMP TO THE 3RD BEHEMOTH WHICH DIDNT FIRE BACK. AFTER CLOSER INSPECTION IT APPEARED THAT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN OUT, PRESUMEBLY BY ASI WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE. MYSELF AND PLEIADES BOARDED THE SHIP LOOKING FOR SAMPLES WHICH WE WERENT SUCCESFULL IN FINDING.

THE 4TH BEHEMOTH GAVE US THE MOST TROUBLE AS THE VALKYRIE PILOTED BY ME, TOOK A MASSIVE TORPEDO BARRAGE AND HEAVILY DAMAGED MY SHIP DISABLING THRUST IN MOST DIRECTIONS AND COMPROMISING MY OXYGEN, I HAD TO TAKE COVER BEHIND THE LEVIATHAN WHICH HAD ALREADY PROVED ITSELF ON PAR WITH THE BEHEMOTH. THE GOA CORVETTE ALSO TOOK HEAVY DAMAGE AS THE BEHEMOTH MANAGE TO HIT IT WITH ITS TENTACLES, AND DAMAGING ITS CONTROL. AFTER THE MNN VESSEL AND THE LEVIATHAN WORKED TOGETHER IN TAKING OUT THE LAST BEHEMOTH WITH THE VALKYRIE STAYING BEHIND AND SENDING VOLLEY´S OF TORPEDOS.

AFTER THE FIGHT WAS OVER I HAD TO RESSUPLY MY OXYGEN ON THE LEVIATHAN, WHICH AFTER TOWED THE MNN VESSELS AWAY FROM THE CARNAGE.
