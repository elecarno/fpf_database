REPORT TYPE: GRID PERFORMANCE

ASSET ASSESSED: `Warship "H.A.D.S"
FACTIONS INVOLVED: `TWC`

COLOQUIAL TITLE: N/A

### PERFORMANCE
- Ship handled well and showed great manvoureability, as per the indended goals of the design.
- Armour configuration worked better than expected, with the ship still largely operational after several close quarters encounters, and almost no damage was sustained to the core allowing for an unharmed jump drive and safe retreats
### IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE
- No beacon/antenna
- Front and back thruster blocks are dependent on the functioning of the flush large hydrogen thruster
- Heavy armour does not extend to hydrogen tanks; armour around tanks had to be repaired multiple times during mission; flow to all thrusters was lost near the end of the mission due to damage to the tanks
### CONCLUSION
- an effective design that successfully accomplishes its primary objectives with only a few design oversights that can most likely be easily dealt with.
