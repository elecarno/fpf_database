### INCIDENT OUTLINE
During a storm, Block 2 BigMcLargeHuge was struck by lightning, resulting in the loss of its medbay and landing gear. At the time, there was no respawn capability at our Demus settlement, so I prioritized repairing the medbay and left the ship hovering above the settlement. Unfortunately, we had no silver in stock and no saved-up medical components, so the primary goal was to rush to a nearby silver mine. 

A suitable silver mine was located near a UNS base, but in the haste to acquire the silver, I made the mistake of forgetting to bring jetpack fuel. Despite the challenging conditions of the storm, I decided to run to the only visible base in the area. Unfortunately, two attempts to contact the occupants via local chat went unanswered. With no other options left and with dwindling fuel reserves, I reluctantly used the last of my fuel to break into the base and commandeer the supplies necessary to complete the repairs. In the process, three doors, one medbay, and one hydrogen tank were hacked. 

I am willing and ready to receive reparation instructions and make payment for damages and inconvenience caused. This is the official incident report posted to Laz Industries report section at this time. where my superiors will see it soon.
