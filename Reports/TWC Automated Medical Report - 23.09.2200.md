**LEVEL THREE FILE**

PATIENT: [[FP-16 Arkady Orlunda]]
CONDITION: `CRITICAL, STABALISED`

DETAILS:
- Right eye ruptured due to explosive decompression of starship CIC module and improper helmet sealing.
- Numerous lacerations across right arm due to shrapnel from shattered cockpit windows. Several pieces of reinforced glass present in wounds.
- Left arm missing with cauterized wound, presumed eviscerated by kinetic artillery round.
- Right knee shattered and left foot dislocated from impact with starship hull during emergency boarding.
- Several ribs broken.
- All vital organs show signs of severe impact trauma

PRESUMED EVENTS:
While piloting the [[TWC-1-07 Warden]], the ship's CIC experienced a critical breach. This caused the internal cockpit windows of the piloting module in which Arkady was seated to shatter into shrapnel which Arkady proceeded to block using her right arm.

From here she ventured into EVA, where a stray artillery round eviscerated her right arm, with the heat cauterizing the wound and welding her suit to the wounded flesh, allowing for a pressurised seal to be maintained.

Arkady then used her suit's jetpack to fly towards an allied starship to seek refuge. During her boarding however, the starship made a rapid manoeuvre and severely impacted Arkady. Ship crews then pulled her into the craft, and she was transported to Federation medical facilities.
