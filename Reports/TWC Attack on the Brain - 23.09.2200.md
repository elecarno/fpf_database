AFTERMATH SUMMARY: AFTER A LONGER FIGHT THAN ANY HAD ANTICIPATED, THE GOAL OF THE MISSION WAS FINALLY ACHIEVED, BUT AT GREAT COST AS ALL FACTIONS HAD LOST ONE OR MULTIPLE SHIPS, INCLUDING CREWMATES

### DAMAGE REPORT

- `THE WARDEN: DESTROYED, THEIA: HEAVY DAMAGE BUT REPAIRABLE, DESTROYER CLASS MK 7: HEAVY DAMAGE AND IS BEING DECOMISSIONED, VALKYRIE MK 2: MINOR DAMAGE`

### DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS
BEFORE THE ENGAGEMENT STARTED, TWC DECIDED TO SPLIT UP THEIR FORCES WITH ARKADY JOINING THE ORBITAL FORCE AND ACTING AS A COMMUNICATION LINK BETWEEN OUR FORCES.

THE ORBITAL FORCE WAS THE FIRST TO ENCOUNTER THE SYMBIOTS, AT FIRST THE FIGHTING WAS LIGHT. BUT AS THE SYMBIOTS FORCES STARTED TO GATHER , THE ORBITAL FORCES BECAME OUTNUMBERED 5:1

THE ORBITAL FORCES STARTED TO TAKE HEAVE DAMAGE, SOME HAD TO FALL BACK FOR REPAIRS INCLUDING THE THEIA, PILOTED BY ARKADY. SHE RETREATED TO A TVA STATION WHERE SHE SWITCED TO HER BACKUP SHIP "THE WARDEN" 

WHEN ARKADY RETURNED TO THE BATTLE THERE WAS ONLY 2 OTHER SHIPS REMAINING AND ARKADY TOOK COMMAND OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE ORBITAL FORCE, BUT WITH THE ODDS SO STACKED AGAINST THEM, THE WARDEN WAS QUICKLY ELIMINATED AND ARKADY WAS RUSHED TO A FEDERATION MEDICAL CENTER AS SHE HAD SUFFERED GREAT INJURIES

WHILE THE ORBITAL BATTLE WAS TAKING PLACE, MEEF AND MYSELF WAS TASKED WITH PROTECTING THE BREACHING TEAM WHILE THEY ELIMINATED THE BRAIN. IT DIDNT TAKE LONG FOR THE HAND TO SHOW UP. WE QUICKLY FOUND OUT THAT OUR WEAPONS WERE INEFFECTIVE, AND I HAD TO DISTRACT IT, WHILE MEEF HELD HIS OWN AGAINST MANY ENEMY SHIPS. IN THE END THE BREACH TEAM COMPLETED THEIR OBJECTIVE AND WE ESCAPED HALE
