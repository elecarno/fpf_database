Title: Law Entry - Support for GCP in Their Conflict with M-C

In response to the ongoing conflict between factions GCP and M-C, the Four Pillars Federation (FPF) has reviewed the situation and examined the evidence provided by GCP. After careful consideration, the FPF acknowledges GCP as the victim of hostile actions perpetrated by M-C.

The FPF condemns any acts of aggression and supports GCP in their efforts to defend themselves and protect their interests. We urge M-C to respond appropriately and seek diplomatic resolutions to address any grievances rather than resorting to violence.

The FPF will closely monitor the situation and provide necessary support to ensure a fair and just resolution. We encourage all factions to seek peaceful solutions to disputes and work towards building a cohesive galactic community in the face of the Symbiote threat.

Integrity, Unity, Justice, Valor.

Signed,
Meefer Radness
High Justiciar of the Four Pillars Federation
