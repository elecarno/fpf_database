COLOQUIAL TITLE: TWC Initial Search Response In Reaction to the Disappearance of Director Zapp

MISSION GOALS: To locate [[FP-01 Zapp]] following his sudden disappearance.
MISSION RESULTS: Despite a quick response to the situation, little of value was uncovered before the mission was forced to be aborted.

### MISSION BREIFING
- Meet with Federation members at [[FP-01 Zapp]]'s last known location (Provided GPS) and investigate the site.
- Proceed with locating[[FP-01 Zapp]] using the intel retrieved by the investigation.
- GPS: `GPS:Unknown Wreckage:-302264.31:69762.61:-1697312.98:#FF75C9F1:`
### DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS
Upon receiving the priority one call, [[TWC]] member [[FP-16 Arkady Orlunda]] stationed at [[TWC-S-04 Valhalla Station]] piloted the [[TWC-1-07 Warden]] from the surface of Orlunda directly to the GPS Marker `GPS:Unknown Wreckage:-302264.31:69762.61:-1697312.98:#FF75C9F1:`. There she convened with [[FP-12 Starbuck]] of  [[ZAP]], and `Argie` of `ASI`.

After exchanging the available information on the situation (the details of which are not relevant to this report, and can be found elsewhere within the federation database), she partnered with [[FP-05 Armion Pleiades III]] of [[FMG]] to investigate potential locations of interest.

This included a sweep search of the `Unknown Wreckage`, [[ZAP-S-02 Orlunda Tower]], [[ZAP-S-03 Orlunda's Cradle]], and a floating ship found near [[ZAP-S-02 Orlunda Tower]] that was found to be an incomplete [[ZAP]] asset. All three searches yielded minimal results and were found to be inconclusive in regards to the operation. The only notable pieces of potential evidence found were:
- an unusual amount of infantry armament present in the lockers aboard the `Unkown Wreckage`
- the lack of a [[ZAP]] welding ship at [[ZAP-S-03 Orlunda's Cradle]] in its usual spot

[[FP-16 Arkady Orlunda]] then proceeded to recover the [[TWC-M-01 Flint Scout Plane]] from its hangar at [[ZAP-S-02 Orlunda Tower]], and joined [[FP-05 Armion Pleiades III]] in Orlunda bound planetfall, landing at [[TWC-S-04 Valhalla Station]]. From here the two entered in communications with radar scanning ships from [[ZAP]] and `ASI`, and proceeded to investigate the signals picked up by these scans. For this, [[FP-16 Arkady Orlunda]] piloted the [[TWC-M-01 Flint Scout Plane]]

A wreckage of a [[ZAP]] starter ship was located, yet it was found to be unrelated and was later noted as a previously discovered site.

Due to critical damage sustained by from severe winds causing a failure in the aerodynamics of the [[TWC-M-01 Flint Scout Plane]], [[FP-16 Arkady Orlunda]] was forced to abort from the mission and return to [[TWC-S-04 Valhalla Station]]. The [[TWC-M-01 Flint Scout Plane]] was lost on the landing.
