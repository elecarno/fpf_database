DATE: `21.09.2200`
REPORT TYPE: MISSION

COLOQUIAL TITLE: `TWC` Initial Search Response In Reaction to the Disappearance of `Director Zapp`

MISSION GOALS: To locate `Director Zapp` following his sudden disappearance.
MISSION RESULTS: Despite a quick response to the situation, little of value was uncovered before the mission was forced to be aborted.

### MISSION BREIFING
- Meet with Federation members at `Director Zapp`'s last known location (Provided GPS) and investigate the site.
- Proceed with locating `Director Zapp` using the intel retrieved by the investigation.
- GPS: `GPS:Unknown Wreckage:-302264.31:69762.61:-1697312.98:#FF75C9F1:`
### DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS
Upon receiving the priority one call, `TWC` member `Arkady Orlunda` stationed at `Valhalla Station` piloted the `Warden Mutlirole Corvette` from the surface of Orlunda directly to the GPS Marker `GPS:Unknown Wreckage:-302264.31:69762.61:-1697312.98:#FF75C9F1:`. There she convened with `Commodore Starbuck` of the `ZAP Corporation`, and `Argie` of `ASI`.

After exchanging the avaliable information on the situation (the details of which are not relevant to this report, and can be found elsewhere within the federation database), she partnered with `Pleiades` of `FMG` to investigate potential locations of interest.

This included a sweep search of the `Unknown Wreckage`, `Orlunda Tower`, `Orlundas Cradle`, and a floating ship found near `Orlunda Tower` that was found to be an incomplete `ZAP Corporation` asset. All three searches yeilded minimal results and were found to be inconclusive in regards to the operation. The only notable pieces of potential evidence found were:
- an unusual amount of infantry armament present in the lockers aboard the `Unkown Wreckage`
- the lack of a `ZAP Corporation` welding ship at `Orlundas Cradle` in its usual spot

`Arkady Orlunda` then proceeded to recover the `Flint Mk2 Scout Plane` from its hangar at `Orlunda Tower`, and joined `Pleiades` in Orlunda bound planetfall, landing at `Valhalla Station`. From here the two entered in communications with radar scanning ships from `ZAP` and `ASI`, and proceeded to investigate the signals picked up by these scans. For this, `Arkady Orlunda` piloted the `Flint Mk2 Scout Plane`

A wreckage of a `ZAP` starter ship was located, yet it was found to be unrelated and was later noted as a previously discovered site.

Due to critical damage sustained by from severe winds causing a failure in the aerodynamics of the `Flint Mk2 Scout Plane`, `Akardy Orlunda` was forced to abort from the mission and return to `Valhalla Station`. The `Flint Mk2 Scout Plane` was lost on the landing.
