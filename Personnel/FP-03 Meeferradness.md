### History / Background
Director Meefer's journey from a peaceful galaxy to the chaos of ATK-07 (Avalon) is one of resilience and determination. Born in a distant system, Meefer had always been fascinated by the vastness of space. His early career saw him rising through the ranks of the military as a captain of a well-respected, state-of-the-art spaceship. In a galaxy where peace prevailed, Meefer's days were marked by exploration, scientific missions, and the occasional diplomatic voyage. He had honed his skills as a leader, fostering loyalty and camaraderie among his crew.

Then came the unforeseen catastrophe - the Symbiote invasion. What was once a tranquil cosmos turned into a battlefield of terror and destruction. The Symbiotes, relentless and voracious, devoured everything in their path, including multiple star systems. Meefer, once a symbol of authority and command, was now a witness to the unimaginable horrors of entire planets being cracked open by the Symbiot war machine. 

Meefer's once-proud military ship was soon reduced to a battered, barely functional vessel. As the Symbiotes closed in, Meefer made the heart-wrenching decision to abandon his home system, leaving behind friends, comrades, and a galaxy that had already been annihilated. Only a few scattered ships remained, bearing witness to the utter devastation wrought by the Symbiotes.

With a skeleton crew and their ship's jump drive compromised, they plunged into an uncharted wormhole, ending up in the midst of the chaos that was ATK-07. Far from their familiar galaxy, they were now in a realm teeming with danger. The journey had taken a heavy toll, leaving their ship battered and their spirits worn. But Meefer refused to yield to despair. He saw an opportunity to rebuild, to turn this hunk of junk into a symbol of hope.

Meefer's leadership skills, forged in the fires of adversity, shone brightly in these dire circumstances. He rallied his crew, each a survivor in their own right, and embarked on a new mission: to carve a place for themselves in ATK-07, to contribute to the fight against the Symbiotes, and to forge alliances with factions that shared their vision of a better future.

As Director of TWC, Meefer is driven by the memory of his once-peaceful galaxy, the friends he lost, and the burning desire to ensure that no other system suffers the same fate. His leadership is a beacon of hope in a galaxy shrouded in darkness, a reminder that even in the face of the most unimaginable horrors, the human spirit can endure and emerge stronger than ever.
