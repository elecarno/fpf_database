### History / Background
Ex-Pilot and officer of the Warden Navy, 5th Assault Legion. A group of stragglers who escaped their home world after suffering a defeat at the hands of Extremist Nationalist Conquerors referred to in their history as the "Colonials". While she never stepped foot on their home world, Kara had a deep respect for her military and its officers. She was an active part in a number of Wars against Man and Symbiote alike, often securing a high place on the pilot's "top scoring" boards.

Over 20 years ago, the Colonials tracked down the 5th Assault Legion in the Arcturus System. A fast and bloody conflict began with heavy casualties on both sides. The 5th Assault Legion was eventually shattered. Cpt. Starbuck, now commanding an Assault Group of a few remaining ships, continued the fight falling onto hit and run tactics. While casualties began to mostly shift to the colonial side, resources were limited and dwindling, the intense combat meant most ships quickly fell into disrepair. Following an unsuccessful raid near Gaia and a failed jump drive, Kara's ship, the "Oracle's Horizon", was shot down and she was heavily injured. Barely reaching an escape pod before "self-fusion overload" was achieved by the EC-0.5 AI Architecture in an attempt to protect OP-SEC.

Now on Gaia alone, only a flight suit, gun and some GURPles to her name. Kara survived by trading for what she needed to survive, spending time in Underground Markets and Dodgy Speakeasys with various civilian populations on Gaia, Arcturus.

Hearing about an evacuation of the system due to Symbiote threat, Starbuck smuggled herself to Damascus via a JB&B Cargo Carrier heading for a new colony.
The next 20 years started with living among the JB&B civilian population, taking what contracts she could get as an unregistered worker and making ends meet. Most of her work consisted of smuggling runs, protection details and occasional bounty hunting work. Starbuck spent her time following the money trial, travelling as part of various contracts as an unregistered pilot, evading authorities and fighting off Pirates. Years spent flying from System to System has given her time to think, growing bitter as she dwelled on past defeats.

Following a drunken night at a station watering hole in the "Nowa Zielona" System. Starbuck heard of a wild, untamed place, a place to forge a new life, a place to take the fight to the Symbiote. Returning to Damascus for the first time since she left, only then finding out remnants of her old legion, The "5th", had managed to survive and reform there... Just for them to be gone again.

Not wasting more time dwelling on the past, Starbuck made her way to "ATK-07" as a volunteer on a small independent vessel.
