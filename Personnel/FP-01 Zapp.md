### History / Background
His previous endeavours left him broke, broken and battered. Desperately looking for a fresh start the migration to this new system came as a once in a lifetime chance. He took a ride as a stowaway on board of one of the ships heading towards this system. Once arrived he used an escape pod to eject from his "one time taxi". Although never scared to speak his mind, Zapp has learned from his past. This time he will wait. This time he will listen. Zapp knew coming to this system alone, leaving behind family and friends, would mean overcoming numerous challenges. Yet walking alone, across the vast planes of this unknown planet, eased his mind. His life was his own once more......and he is eager to see where it will lead.
