### History / Background
The last survivor of the Lydian family heritage; a line of ship builders known for their exclusive deals and specialist commissions. Formerly worked for the "Void Corporation", a company that worked closely with the SOLREP navy to develop experimental craft and new technologies at sites situated out in deep space. During a restructuring of the SOLREP navy, the Void Corporation and all associated peoples were declared as part of governmental corruption and treasonists. Many members of the Void Corporation were given the choice of imprisonment, or exile to atk-07. Avery of course, chose the latter. He now seeks to continue his family's legacy and the allow the work of his colleagues at the former Void Corporation to live on. (edited)
