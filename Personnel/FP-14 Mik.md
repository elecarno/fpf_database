Mik used to be part of an old school mercenary faction called (LMF) LeviÂ´s Mercenary Fleet. (Levi being the leader) in a solar system simply called sector 42. Its a highly corrupt system perfect for people wanting to make cash in questionable ways. The leader of sector 42 (Arnok) had a political rival he wanted to get rid of. and Hired LMF to deal with it. but once the task was done, Arnok send his entire fleet towards LMF on a suprise attack has he didnt want evidence of what he hired us to do. we were completly unprepared for the attack and scattered all over the galaxy.
