POST OPERATION MEDICAL REPORT

PATIENT: Arkady Orlunda

CONDITION UPON ADMISSION: CRITICAL, STABILISED

DETAILS OF INJURY:

Right Eye: Ruptured due to explosive decompression of starship CIC module and improper helmet sealing.
Right Arm: Multiple lacerations from shrapnel caused by shattered cockpit windows, with remnants of reinforced glass lodged in various depths.
Left Arm: Entire limb missing with a cauterized wound, most likely due to a kinetic artillery round.
Right Leg: Knee region severely compromised and shattered.
Left Leg: Dislocated foot, likely due to high-velocity impact.
Torso: Multiple fractured ribs.
Vital Organs: Severe impact trauma observed, though no internal bleeding detected upon admission.

TREATMENT & PROCEDURES PERFORMED:

Right Eye: A cybernetic ocular implant was installed after thoroughly cleaning and preparing the socket. This new eye offers enhanced night vision and can interface with Federation HUD systems.

Right Arm: The lacerations were sutured and disinfected. Embedded shrapnel, including the reinforced glass pieces, were meticulously removed using surgical nanobots. Due to deep tissue damage, regenerative biogel was applied to promote tissue regrowth.

Left Arm: A state-of-the-art cybernetic prosthetic was attached to the remaining upper arm section. This prosthetic has been tailored to match Arkady's physiological parameters and can mimic the full range of natural arm functions. It also includes some advanced features like integrated tools and enhanced strength.

Right Leg: With the knee being completely shattered, a cybernetic joint replacement was necessary. Post-operation, Arkady will benefit from a more durable knee with improved mobility.

Left Leg: The foot was successfully relocated, and the affected area was immobilized to facilitate bone and tissue healing. A biogenic cast was applied, which will dissolve once the healing is complete.

Torso: Using a combination of traditional and advanced medical techniques, the fractured ribs were set and knitted together using osteo-regenerative therapy.
Vital Organs: Nanobots were administered intravenously to repair tissue damage on a cellular level, restoring functionality and ensuring no further complications.

POST-TREATMENT & RECOVERY:

Arkady Orlunda has shown remarkable resilience and adaptability, especially when it comes to integrating and using her new cybernetic implants and prosthetics. Her recovery was supplemented with physical and psychological therapy sessions, to help her cope with the traumatic events and adapt to her new physical state.

As of the latest evaluation, FP-16 Arkady Orlunda is deemed to have made a full recovery and is fit for service once more. Furthermore, due to advances made by our biomedical research division, Arkaday's Symbiote infection is in full remission and their symptoms are receding. We have cured the Symbiote disease. Regular follow-ups and check-ups are advised to monitor her cybernetic systems and overall health.

This is Arkady Orlunda, it feels good to be back.

I give my deepest gratitude to the all the staff and personnel of the Last Light Hospital. I was hesitant to seek treatment at first, however I am ever grateful that fate had forced my hand as I see now that I was so incredibly wrong. To anyone else dealing with Symbiote disease or infection, or any form of, these people know what they are doing. You may trust your lives with them.

I've been reading of the aftermath of our battle. I will be going to visit the surviving crew of my ships to mourn the loss of our comrades with them. We have battles yet to fight, and with allies like the Groundhog Coalition, our mission to eradicate the Symbiote threat looks more and more promising with each snowy, icy, dusty, or molten sunrise of our system.

Death to the One! Our bodies it may damage, but our souls it will never destroy!
