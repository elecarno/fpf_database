*A series of tones, beeps, and periods of static suddenly blare out across unicomms before stopped just as abruptly as it began.
The transmission was a raw data leakage originating from somewhere on Orlunda, and when processed reads as follows:*

A medical examination done by teams at the `Lydian Workshop` revealed that Arkady has been infected by an unknown Symbiote virus. The infection was shown to be progressing extremely slowly and it is unknown what its long term effects may be.

Present symptoms:
- slight myopia.
- red pigmentation in the irises.
- slightly increased bone density.

We can treat this. Our medical personnel in conjunction with our field research teams have successfully found a way to reverse this infection.

**TWC - GCP**

Treat what? I'm fine. Do not read into leaked and potentially altered information in such ways. 
***
**MNN - GCP & FPF**

We have had experiences with infected personnel in the past. An extremely dangerous situation. The subject was under the Symbiote's will and we lost far too many good people. Based on the information revealed, we would recommend that Arkady is immediately quarantined and monitored by medical and security personnel.

**GCP:**

If there is even the smallest chance that you have been infected by the Symbiotes, you owe it to your people and to this sector to seek immediate treatment.

Our field research teams have walked Hale themselves. Sampled the Symbiote’s tissue. Learned exactly what it is and how to effectively kill its infection.

Please report to the Last Light hospital for immediate treatment at your earliest convenience.

Fine. I will make sure to check in before the battle tonight.

**GCP**

Thank you. Please report directly to the quarantined suite in room 3.

Our chief of medicine will administer the treatment personally. 

**GCP to MNN**

Our schedules keep misaligning. Let’s get this battle out of the way tonight and then meet. We have much to discuss.
