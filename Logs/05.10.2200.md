**ZAP to ALL** Today, at 1910 hours Orlunda Tower Control informed me of a Barge that had drifted past the Tower. A boarding crew consisting of H-C, ASI and GCP took control of the vessel, it seemed it had been abandoned and systematically powered down. Aboard the vessel a number of medical logs were found pertaining to the condition of Zapp. He lasted 6 days in captivity under brutal torture before he passed from his injuries. Killed in cold blood by a group of people wanting to take control of every major faction in the system. Starting with Zapp-Corp... Zapp never gave in. I would have never expected otherwise. To honor him, a funeral will be arranged, details will be released when possible. May he rest in peace. As for those who are behind these acts. I am coming for you. You know who you are...

- Starbuck, ZAP EF.

Goodevening Avalon, John Flurgundy here with a special broadcast.
Founder and CEO of Zapp-Corp… ´Zapp´ has been found on board of a barge. No life longer within him.
The conditions in which he was found are under investigation as we speak. The Zapp-Corp Board of Directors have started the official procedures to elect a new CEO for Zapp-Corp. This means we are currently in a phase of reorganization and can not commit to long-term proposals until the new CEO has been appointed.
We will mourn his loss, but we will stay vigilant to let his legacy live.
